# proposal:instructions

## Main Objective
```
The project of the course gives you an opportunity to implement what you have learned in
the course in a project of interest. There will be two possible tracks for groups that want to
submit their own project proposal:
```

## Kaggle Challenges. 
```
In Kaggle challenges https://www.kaggle.com/competitions, you
are expected to choose an open competition, which requires you to study the problem
and propose a solution. Note that you must choose an open competition with image or
text or speech data to apply deep learning models there. You should also check the data
size because the project should not require a lot of computational power i.e. GPU. Note
that in this track, you will be judged on your ability to apply a methodology and a sound
solution that works well in a challenging problem. 
```

```
Team Formation [Deadline: Sunday 11:59PM, September 21st, 2025]
Students are required to form a team of Four (4) members for the course project. Please
submit your team’s detail by email to the lecturer and the Lead TA following the email
inquiries guideline. A Q&A discussion forum will be created for the course on Moodle and
you can use the platform to open a discussion on team formation related topic. Students
who cannot find a team will be randomly shuƯled in incomplete teams. The team, once
formed, will stay the same until the end.
Proposal Submission [Deadline: Sunday 11:59PM, October 5th, 2025] (Counts for 10%
of the course project grade) 
```


You should write a one-page proposal for the course project to cover the following topics:

### Problem Statement and Application: (Ion Turcan 40154098)
```
provide a background about the topic to be
investigated and specify why the problem is interesting and important? What are the
associated challenges of the problem application? What are your expectations/goals
throughout developing the application of interest?
```
### What reading material
```
(e.g. papers, scientific reports, etc) will you examine to provide
context and background?
```

### Possible Methodology: 
```
highlight the possible method or algorithm you are proposing.
Are there any existing implementations to be used and how will you use them? How are you
planning to improve or modify such implementations? You may not have the exact answer
here but try to give an answer that you will follow as much as possible.
```

### Metric Evaluation: 
```
Discuss how you will evaluate your results both in terms of
qualitative and quantitative analysis. Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g.
plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or
compare your results with (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)? All these
metric evaluations will be used to assess and evaluate the pipeline and your expectations
regarding the kind of results/performance to be achieved.
```

### Gantt Chart: 
```
use an additional page (supplemental material) to illustrate a Gantt
chart of the project development to list (a) schedules and (b) items of milestones and
deliverables. Note that you cannot use this page to extend your proposal description.
```
### Bibliography: 
```
use an additional page to extend your reference list cited in your
proposal. The citations may include, but not limited to, published papers and domain links.
(include a link to your dataset). Please note that failure to properly cite your references
constitutes to a plagiarism.
You will be given the opportunity to submit your proposal for revision by the professor/LeadTA, before the final graded submission. Only the admin (one person) of your team needs to
upload the proposal in PDF file in Moodle.
```

### Formatting:
```
For the report format, please consult “Reports Formatting” Section in this guideline. Our
team (TAs and lecturer) will review your proposal and, if it is acceptable, you may proceed
with developing the next phase of your project. Otherwise, we will instruct you to either revise
or re-write the proposal according to the guidelines of the course project. All teams are highly
encouraged to put great eƯort on preparing the first proposal draft to avoid further delays in
project developments.
